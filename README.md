<h1>Automated Plant Watering System</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  The Automated Plant Watering System is designed to monitor soil moisture and atmospheric humidity levels, providing water to plants only when needed. By leveraging an Arduino Uno, sensors, and a water pump, the system ensures optimal soil moisture while conserving water. This project is particularly beneficial for large gardens and during periods when manual watering isn't feasible.

<strong>Key features:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Automatically turns on/off the water pump based on soil moisture and humidity levels.</li>
  <li>Alerts with a buzzer when water levels are too low.</li>
  <li>Reduces water wastage and improves plant productivity.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Components Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Arduino Uno</strong>: Microcontroller to manage sensors and control devices.</li>
  <li><strong>Soil Moisture Sensors</strong>: Measures soil water content.</li>
  <li><strong>Humidity Sensor</strong>: Detects atmospheric humidity.</li>
  <li><strong>Submersible Water Pump</strong>: Supplies water to plants.</li>
  <li><strong>Water Level Sensor</strong>: Monitors water levels in the reservoir.</li>
  <li><strong>Motor Driver</strong>: Controls pump speed.</li>
  <li><strong>Relay Switch</strong>: Manages the pumpâ€™s power supply.</li>
  <li><strong>Piezo Buzzer</strong>: Alerts for low water levels.</li>
  <li>Additional components like a breadboard, jumper wires, LCD display, and power supply.</li>
</ul>
